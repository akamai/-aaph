# App & API Protector Hybrid

App & API Protector Hybrid is a software solution you can install within your own infrastructure to provide comprehensive Web Application and API Protection (WAAP). It detects and mitigates application threats in HTTP and HTTPS traffic as they attempt to pass through â€‹its core component, Hybrid Protector, to reach your origin data centers.
In the first software release, you can deploy Hybrid Protector as a sidecar to your Kubernetes Controller. Once deployed, Hybrid Protector runs alongside your Kubernetes Ingress Controller, processing incoming HTTP requests and providing an extra layer of security. This repository includes all files you need to successfully set up and run Hybrid Protector on your infrastructure.
